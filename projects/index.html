            <h2>Ultra Crush Siblings</h2>
            <p>UCS is my attempt to adapt what I learned from Alley Brawler into a Smash Bros inspired game for my APCSP Create PT. However, gameplay wise it is far inferior to Alley Brawler.</p>

            <h2>Cosmo Quest</h2>
            <p>Cosmo Quest is a game I made for the Code211 hackathon with a couple friends. Due to it being developed in a very strict time frame the gameplay isn't completely developed, but we did very well for the timeframe we were given.</p>
